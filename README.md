# PointInPolygon
(Unity-C#) This class assesses whether a point lies within a polygon by employing a ray-casting technique and tracking the intersections. If the count is even, the point is considered inside the polygon; otherwise, it is deemed outside. Notably, points residing on the circumference of the polygon are treated as inside.
